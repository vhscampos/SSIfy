{"name":"SSIfy","tagline":"A parameterized tool for LLVM to convert programs for static analyses.","body":"## Overview\r\nSSIfy is a parameterized tool for constructing program representations suitable for program static analyses. Given an input program, it can be converted to forms such as Extended Static Single Assignment, Static Single Use, etc.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation is to offer an all-in-one solution, which is capable of producing program representations that combine properties of different forms. That is, one can transform a program to a representation which is, loosely speaking, e-SSA and SSU at the same time.\r\n\r\nCurrent version: 2.0.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nSSIfy works on LLVM 3.7. Along with installing SSIfy, it's necessary to deploy a modified version of LLVM's Dominators.h, also provided here.\r\n\r\n## Modes of operation\r\n\r\nSSIfy has two modes of operation: upwards and downwards. These should be selected according to the purpose of the analysis that will follow the transformation. That is, if the analysis flows information down (e.g. tainted flow analysis, range analysis), you should set the downwards mode on. Likewise, if the analysis flows information up (e.g. class inference), you should set the upwards mode on.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the flow direction option, you can also specify where the live range splitting should occur. The two options are (i) in the exit of conditional branches and (ii) after uses of values.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nThis is done as a compiler pass that works on LLVM 3.7, written in C++.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nIn order to use SSIfy on LLVM bitcode programs, one _has_ to run it through the following passes first:\r\n\r\n1. mem2reg;\r\n\r\n2. break-crit-edges;\r\n\r\nAlso, for cosmetic reasons, it is recommended to run _instnamer_ pass after all passes that create new variables.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\n1. Build LLVM: http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html\r\n2. Put _Dominators.h_ inside _llvm/include/llvm/IR/_.\r\n3. Put the _SSIfy_ folder inside _llvm/lib/Transforms/_.\r\n4. Build SSIfy by running _make_ in the root of the build dir.\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\nAfter building LLVM and SSIfy, you can try it with the command:\r\n\r\n$ opt -mem2reg -break-crit-edges [... -instnamer] -load /path/to/SSIfy.so -ssify [-v] _FLAGS_ Input.bc -o Output.bc\r\n\r\n-v: verbose mode\r\n\r\n_FLAGS_ determine how SSIfy will split live ranges in the program:\r\n\r\n1. -essa: Extended Static Single Assignment\r\n2. -ssu: Static Single Use\r\n3. -essa-up: upwards e-SSA\r\n4. -ssu-up upwards SSU\r\n\r\n## Further\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, I'd be happy to address them.
